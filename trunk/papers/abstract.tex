\section{Abstract}
In this paper we present new techniques for the automated construction of state space representations of complex multi-terrain grid maps with minimal information loss. Our approach involves the use of graph annotations to record the amount of maximal traversable space at each location on a map. We couple this with a cluster-based hierarchical abstraction technique to build highly compact yet complete representations of the original problem. We further outline the design of a new planner, Annotated Hierarchical A* (AHA*), and demonstrate how a single abstract graph can be used to plan for many different agents, including different sizes and terrain traversal capabilities.
We undertake an empirical analysis of the performance of our new planner and contrast it with a low-level variant, Annotated A* (AA*) . The experimental results show that AHA* is able to generate near-optimal solutions with an exponential reduction in the comparative search effort and peak memory requirements over AA*. Meanwhile, our abstraction technique is able to generate equivalent representations of large problems with complex topographies while using just a fraction of the storage space required by the original grid map.
