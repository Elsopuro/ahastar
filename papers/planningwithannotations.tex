\section{Annotated A*}
\label{aha:aastar}
Having defined a technique for annotating a graph with pertinent information about important topographical features in the environment, we turn our attention to how one may leverage our newfound information richness to discover suitable paths for diverse sets of agents. \\ \newline
We use a variation on the well-known A* algorithm \cite{astar} to compute an optimal shortest path between a start and goal node.  Our approach differs from the standard implementation by requiring two additional parameters for each query: minimum clearance and a set of traversable terrains; these correspond to the size and capability attributes of the agent under consideration and are used to evaluate nodes before they are added to the open list. \\ \newline
